# Python Interview Questions with Answers
## 1. What is Python?
  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
## 2. What are Python's built-in data types?
  - Python has several built-in data types, including:
    - Numeric Types: `int`, `float`, `complex`
    - Sequence Types: `list`, `tuple`, `range`
    - Text Type: `str`
    - Mapping Type: `dict`
    - Set Types: `set`, `frozenset`
    - Boolean Type: `bool`
## 3. What is PEP 8?
  - PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. It covers topics such as naming conventions, code layout, indentation, and more.
## 4. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
  - A list is mutable, meaning its elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable, meaning once it is created, its elements cannot be changed. Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.
## 5. How do you handle exceptions in Python?
  - Exceptions in Python can be handled using the `try` and `except` blocks. You can also use `finally` to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. Example:
    ```python
    try:
        # Code that may raise an exception
    except SomeException as e:
        # Handle the exception
    finally:
        # Code that will always execute
    ```
## 6. What is a Python decorator?
  - A decorator in Python is a function that modifies the behavior of another function or method. It allows you to wrap another function to extend its behavior without permanently modifying it. Decorators are often used for logging, access control, and caching.
    Example:
    ```python
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            func()
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
        return wrapper  
    @my_decorator
    def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")
    say_hello()
    ``` 
## 7. What is the difference between `deepcopy` and `copy` in Python?
  - The `copy` module provides two functions: `copy()` and `deepcopy()`. The `copy()` function creates a shallow copy of an object, meaning it creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects. The `deepcopy()` function creates a deep copy, meaning it creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects, ensuring that changes to the copied object do not affect the original object.
    Example:
    ```python
    import copy
    original = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)
    deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)
    shallow_copied[0][0] = 'changed'
    print(original)  # Output: [['changed', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    print(deep_copied)  # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    ```
## 8. What is the purpose of the `self` keyword in Python?
  - The `self` keyword in Python is used to represent the instance of the class. It allows access to the attributes and methods of the class in Python's object-oriented programming. It is the first parameter of instance methods in a class and is used to refer to the instance itself.
    Example:
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value  # 'self' refers to the instance of MyClass
        def display(self):
            print(self.value)
    obj = MyClass(10)
    obj.display()  # Output: 10
    ```
## 9. What is list comprehension in Python?
  - List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (like a list or range). The syntax is `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`.
    Example:
    ```python
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
    print(squares)  # Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
    ```
## 10. What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?
  - The `is` operator checks for object identity, meaning it checks whether two references point to the same object in memory. The `==` operator checks for value equality, meaning it checks whether the values of two objects are equal, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory.
    Example:
    ```python
    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = a
    c = a[:]
    print(a is b)  # Output: True (same object)
    print(a == c)  # Output: True (same values)
    print(a is c)  # Output: False (different objects)
    ```
## 11. What are Python generators?
  - Python generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but they generate values on the fly and do not store them in memory. They are defined using functions with the `yield` keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over. Generators are memory efficient and useful for working with large datasets.
    Example:
    ```python
    def count_up_to(n):
        count = 1
        while count <= n:
            yield count
            count += 1      
    for number in count_up_to(5):
        print(number)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    ```
## 12. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?
  - The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once. This means that even in a multi-threaded program, only one thread can execute Python code at a time. The GIL can be a limitation for CPU-bound multi-threaded programs, but it does not affect I/O-bound programs as they can release the GIL while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
## 13. How do you create a virtual environment in Python?
  - A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, along with additional packages. You can create a virtual environment using the `venv` module (available in Python 3.3 and later) or the `virtualenv` package. Hereâ€™s how to create a virtual environment using `venv`:
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
    To activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:   
      ```bash
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```
    To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
## 14. What is the purpose of the `with` statement in Python?
  - The `with` statement in Python is used to wrap the execution of a block of code within methods defined by a context manager. It ensures that resources are properly managed, such as opening and closing files, or acquiring and releasing locks. The context manager handles setup and teardown operations automatically, which helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and more readable.
    Example:
    ```python
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
    # The file is automatically closed after the block is executed   
    # No need to explicitly close the file, it will be closed automatically
    ```
## 15. What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__` in Python?
  - The `__str__` method is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object, which is returned by the `str()` function or when using `print()`.
  - The `__repr__` method is used to define an unambiguous string representation of an object, which is returned by the `repr()` function. The goal of `__repr__` is to provide a string that, when passed to `eval()`, would recreate the object (if possible).
    Example:
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
        def __str__(self):
            return f"MyClass with value: {self.value}"
        def __repr__(self):
            return f"MyClass({self.value})"
    obj = MyClass(10)
    print(str(obj))   # Output: MyClass with value: 10
    print(repr(obj))  # Output: MyClass(10)
    ```
## 16. How do you read and write files in Python?
  - You can read and write files in Python using the built-in `open()` function. The `open()` function takes the file name and mode as arguments. Common modes include:
    - `'r'` for reading,
    - `'w'` for writing (overwrites the file),
    - `'a'` for appending to the file,
    - `'b'` for binary mode.
    Example of reading a file:
    ```python
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
    ```
    Example of writing to a file:
    ```python
    with open('file.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, World!")
    ```
    Example of appending to a file: 
    ```python   
    with open('file.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write("\nAppending a new line.")
    ```
## 17. What is the purpose of the `pass` statement in Python?
  - The `pass` statement in Python is a null operation; it is used as a placeholder in blocks of code where syntactically some code is required but you do not want to execute any action. It is often used in function definitions, loops, or conditional statements where you plan to implement functionality later.
    Example:
    ```python
    def my_function():
        pass  # Placeholder for future implementation   
    if condition:
        pass  # Do nothing if condition is met
    for i in range(10):
        pass  # Placeholder for future code
    ```
## 18. What is the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python?
  - `*args` and `**kwargs` are used in function definitions to allow the function to accept a variable number of arguments.
    - `*args` allows you to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. It collects these arguments into a tuple.
    - `**kwargs` allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. It collects these arguments into a dictionary.
    Example:
    ```python
    def my_function(*args, **kwargs):
        print("Positional arguments:", args)
        print("Keyword arguments:", kwargs)
    my_function(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=30)
    # Output:
    # Positional arguments: (1, 2, 3)
    # Keyword arguments: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
    ```
## 19. How do you create a class in Python?
  - You can create a class in Python using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon. The class can contain attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define its behavior. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value  # Instance variable
        def display(self):
            print(f"The value is: {self.value}")
    obj = MyClass(10)
    obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 10
    ```
## 20. What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python classes?
  - The `__init__` method in Python is a special method called the constructor. It is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the attributes of the class instance. It can take parameters to set initial values for the instance variables.
    Example:
    ```python
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value  # Initialize instance variable
        def display(self):
            print(f"The value is: {self.value}")
    obj = MyClass(10)   
    obj.display()  # Output: The value is: 10
    ```
